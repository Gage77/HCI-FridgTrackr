Since Quincy Jones spends a majority of his time on the road jumping from state to state and living off of the food he can carry with him, he would like to be able to quickly and easily look at the total cost of potential grocery purchases, as well as view the price if he were to toggle on and off the food items within the Fridg Trackr app. He often only uses his phone when he can access free wifi, though it would be useful to be able to view all of his items and possibly search for some saved items without the need to connect to a network. He also is slightly hard of sight, so being able to do the above without having to strain his eyes (i.e. having large icons and text and/or adjustable resolutions for icons and text) would be extremely beneficial.
Due to the exorbitant size of Janice Jacklyns stock within her doomsday bunker, it can often be a nightmare to keep track of every food item in storage (in particular their expiration dates) without having a huge stack of papers to go through. She would use the Fridg Trackr app to quickly sort through all of the major categories of her stock and view each individual items expiration date. She would most likely do this while walking among the several shelving units that store the food, so having a display that is easy to ready and a menu system that is easy to navigate while walking would be ideal. Additionally, since she keeps her cold storage separate, she would need to be able to divide her stock into two separate major categories (cold storage and dry storage).
Because Arthur Dents 3 children are somewhat picky eaters, he would like to be able to use the Fridg Trackr app to easily store his kids favorite items and go back to view them at the touch of a button or the application of a filter. Additionally, because he is trying to be health conscious in regards to the food that he purchases for his kids, he would also like to be able to view basic health information (recommended serving size, nutritional info, etc.) about each item. Finally, as he is a single parent and does not have a lot of time to lookup recipes to cook for himself and his kids, being able to view simple recipes that use the foodstuffs that his kids like would be extremely useful in a pinch.
