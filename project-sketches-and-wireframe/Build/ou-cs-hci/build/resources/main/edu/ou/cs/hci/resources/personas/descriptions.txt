Quincy Jones is a 24 year old male recent graduate from Oregon State University who has decided to take a year for himself and travel across the United States, experiencing the cultures and societies that he missed out on in his youth spent in the great state of Oregon. Although he is traveling and plans on purchasing most of his meals from restaurants on the road, he would still like to keep a small stockpile of food on the off chance that he runs out of money or needs a quick snack. Monitoring food costs is also a huge problem to overcome, as he is currently unemployed and living off of his last paycheck he received from his job working at OSU. 

Janice Jacklyn is a 35 year old self-proclaimed doomsday prepper who lives in central Illinois. Having graduated from college with a degree in agriculture and sustainability, Janice set out to establish a self-sustaining bunker for when things go awry. Her facility has stockpiles of food and water that will last for several years without expiring, as well as power generators and tools to allow for hunting and farming. She considers herself a very hands on person, capable of solving difficult problems with her skill and wit. 

Arthur Dent is 42 year old blue collar worker and  a single parent of 3 children living in a house situated on the end of a village in the West Country. He struggles to keep tabs on his food storage and maintaining a supply of snacks and food that his 3 children (who are very picky eaters) will enjoy without breaking the bank. He also frequently goes on long trips with his kids, so knowing the expiration dates for all of the food in his pantry and fridge would be extremely useful.
