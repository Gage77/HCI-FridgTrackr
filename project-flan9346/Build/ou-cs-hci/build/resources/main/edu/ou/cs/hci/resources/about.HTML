<p>FridgTrackr is an application designed to help users track the contents of their fridge.
    After they go grocery shopping they can enter what they bought. After they have they can browse
    the database of recipes to see what they can make with what they have. If the user doesn't not
    have the required ingredients the app will inform them, and allow them to add these items to their
    grocery list (another database our app manages).</p>

<h4>Hunter Black</h4>
<p>Hunter help recorded our thoughts during our group meetings, and helped to
    integrate new code into our group builds. He also was the one to initially
    suggest that our group should use GitHub and helped to ensure that our latest
    builds were always available on our repository. In addition we used
    his menu item layout in our final build.</p>
<h4>Alex Cobb</h4>
<p>Alex was not always able to make our group meetings.
    However when it came time to decide on the schema of our
    CSV files he was very helpful and proposed most of the
    ideas we used for our CSV schema. He also helped to
    design the OOP structure we have been trying to move
    towards in our last few projects.</p>
<h4>Melissa Wilson</h4>
<p>Melissa created add and back buttons we have been using.
    In addition she helped to integrate new code into our
    group build alongside Hunter. She was also the only one
    that was able to implement the selection coloring that
    we wanted and so we added her code to the group build.</p>
<h4>Sarah Myers</h4>
<p>Sarah was very involved with our decision making process when ever we met
    as a group. She provided valuable input and often helped to decide the
    direction our group would take with the next build. In addition we integrated
     her code for our filters.</p>
<p><br />This application was created as a project for the class HCI at
    OU details about the program can be found <a href="http://www.ou.edu/coe/cs&nbsp;">here</a></p>
