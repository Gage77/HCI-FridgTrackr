      <h3>What is FridgTrackr?</h3>
      <p>
        FridgTrackr is a database and browsing based application centered around the idea of being able to
        quickly view and sort through items in one's pantry/fridge, as well as keep track of relavent information
        about those items. FridgTrackr also allows for storing of a grocery list, as well as the storage of recipes
        that can be looked up and filtered based on a variety of factors.In addition, FridgTrackr aims to provide a
        user interface that is intuitive and easy to learn, while still maintaining the functionality of a relatively
        high quality database application.
